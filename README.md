# STM32F411RE Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my embedded systems learning repository!  
This project documents my hands-on learning with the **STM32F411RE** microcontroller based on the **ARM Cortex-M4 processor** using the **Nucleo-F411RE development board**.

I'm a passionate beginner (a.k.a. "new bee") exploring embedded firmware development using **STM32CubeIDE**.

## 📘 What I'm Learning

### 💡 Microcontroller: STM32F411RE
- Based on ARM Cortex-M4 core.
- Developed using STMicroelectronics’ Nucleo platform.
- I'm diving deep into understanding how the microcontroller operates — starting from registers to low-level programming.

### 🛠️ Development Environment
- **STM32CubeIDE** – official IDE for STM32 development.
- Register-level programming with reference to STM32F411RE datasheet and RM0383 reference manual.

## 🛤️ On the Way…
This is just the beginning of my embedded journey. I’ll be sharing:
- More register-level examples
- UART, Timers, Interrupts
- Peripherals and driver development

Stay tuned for more learning logs and code experiments! 😎  
**Let’s blink, debug, and build!**
